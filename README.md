Useful additions to inbuilt [child_process] module.<br>
ðŸ“¦ [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extra-child-process),
ðŸ“œ [Files](https://unpkg.com/extra-child-process/),
ðŸ“° [Docs](https://nodef.github.io/extra-child-process/).

Have you heard of [bash] or [command prompt]? These programs are called **shells**.
They **watch what you type**, and treat it as requests to **run particular programs**.
Programs themselves are just names on the *file system*, and the shell **searches**
**them in a particular manner** (controlled with *environment variables* such as [PATH]).
Our programs as based on [UNIX principles], where each program can accept an
**initial input** through **arguments**, **runtime input** through `stdin` *input stream*
`#0`, and provide its **runtime output** into `stdout` *output stream* `#1` (along
with `stderr` *output stream* `#2` for *errors*). The output of a program can be fed
into another program through **piping** `|`, allowing us to **set up a pipline** of
programs to achieve a **complex operation** (without having to write a new program).

[child_process] is an **inbuilt Node.js module** that enables us to *execute specific*
*programs directly* ([execFile]), *or through the shell* ([exec]). **Executing**
**programs through the shell** is hyper convenient as we are allowed to *use its*
*inbuilt commands and features* such as *piping of streams*, but is does come with a
**security risk** (such as [command injection]) **when using unsanitized user input** to
generate the sequence of instructions to be executed on the shell. When possible,
**execting specific programs directly** using [execFile] would be a suitable approach.
[spawn] can be used when we want to start a new process and **control** its *input* and
*output streams*. [exec] and [execFile] are implemented on top of [spawn]. [fork] is a
special case of [spawn], used specifically to launch *new Node.js* processes.

This package provides **async versions of functions** (in additon to the
existing *sync* and *callback*-based functions), which are not included with the
inbuilt `child_process` module. They are named as `*Async` can be used with
`Promise`-based asynchronous programming using the `await` keyword. [spawnAsync]
is a special case here, which returns a `PromiseWithChild` which is essentially
a `Promise` with a `.child` property to allow `ChildProcess` to be directly
accessed similar to [spawn]. In addition, **callback-based functions**, such as
[exec], also **behave as async functions** when a *callback* is **not provided**.
Functions for **locating path of executable(s)** such as [which] and [whichAll]
are also included. Design was based on local ideas and [literature survey].
